# FacialKeypoints
Facial KeyPoints Detection

------------------------

### Project Objectives ###

Facial keypoints detections is an important problem in computer vision field used on the following tasks:
* Facial tracking
* Facial pose recognition 
* Facial filters
* Emotion recognition

### Project Pipeline ###

* Load Dataset
* Process Dataset
* Create Model
* Train
* Evaluate
* Test on video

The databased used for this project was provided by #Udacity# provided on the following link: https://github.com/udacity/P1_Facial_Keypoints

The base model used for this project was based on the following paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.00977.pdf

The two test videos for this project were use from the dataset stored  site here where I will put a reference for their work:
